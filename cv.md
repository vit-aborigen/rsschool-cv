Also enthusiastic programmer with a passion for problem-solving and creativity. My journey in programming began during my school and university years, where I consistently participated in coding contests. Despite pursuing a career in project management, I find solace in returning to programming. I love coding because it lets me be creative and make cool things. It's like a constant source of joy, and I'm always excited to dive into the world of algorithms and code.
